This is a code implementing the A* path planning algorithm for a point robot navigating in a static environment with obstacles. The algorithm computes an optimal path from a start point to a goal point while avoiding obstacles
Inputs: step size, initial coordinates and orientation of the robot, final coordinates and orientation of the robot.
Make sure to enter the x and y coordinates with a space in between them.
The code gives an output of the video of the A* implementation.
